# Temp Counter

- Start by setting 0&deg;C as the starting temprature (the degrees symbol can be printed using `$deg;` in HTML)
- When the buttons are pressed, determine which was pressed and increase or decrese the starting temperature
- When the temprature is increased, assume C, but give the user the number in both C and F (C * 2 + 32)
- If the temprature goes above 0, set the bacground colour to something warm, if less than 0, use a cold colour
